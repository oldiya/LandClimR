# landclimR

Test runner

## Principles 

* We use camel case for all files and names 
* the default tags in the input parameter files collect the values of the last published LandClim version (up to now 2.0.0??). Variations during experimentations should we kept in personal experimental files.
* Makes sense to keep the package usable for decadal and annual 
* All the LandClim understanding thoughts are collected internally  in the project landclim issues. If they are meant to make the next update in the users library the tag XXXX must be used
* Every time you have a question of how to use landclim first look into the issues of landclim project, second look in the src andtry to find the answer and 3th write an issue with the question or the question and the solution if you already found it. Your answer might help others and tag the people that might be able to help you 
* landclimR is meant to be kept general and basic, specific projects experiments should clone and develop based on this functions if the user whish so and if a new functions or improvement of current is developed with a general use, this one can be added into the project after a group discussion
*
