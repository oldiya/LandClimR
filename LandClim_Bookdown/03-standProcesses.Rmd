## Forest stand scale processes

LandClim distinguishes between three different types of stand-scale
processes:

(1) Tree growth,

(2) Tree mortality

(3) Tree regeneration.

These processes are simulated for each cohort, i.e. groups of trees of
the same species and the same age within each patch (i.e. landscape
grid-cell). 

LandClim calculates the average biomass of an individual tree ($B_i$)
and the number of trees ($N_c$) within each cohort. The biomass
($B_{c}$) per cohort is thus calculated as:

$$
\begin{equation}
  B_{c} = B_{i} \cdot N_{c}
  (\#eq:biomasspercohoreq)
\end{equation}
$$

The change of cohort biomass per year is calculated with the
differential equation \@ref(eq:ChangeBiomassPerCohortEq). The first term
tracks the changes in biomass of individual plants (i.e. representation
of growth), whereas the second term tracks changes in the number of
individuals ($N_{c}$) within a cohort (thus accounting for mortality).

$$
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dB_{c}}{dt} = \frac{dB_{i}}{dt} \cdot N_{c} + \frac{dN_{c}}{dt} %\cdot B_{i}
  (\#eq:ChangeBiomassPerCohortEq)
\end{equation}
$$

### Treegrowth

In LandClim, tree growth is simulated via functional relationships,
which are based on a species-specific maximum growth rate ($r_{s}$;
growth under optimum environmental conditions) and a species-specific
maximum biomass ($K_{s}$; maximum biomass an individual tree of a
certain species can reach), representing growth under optimum
environmental conditions. To account for the reduction of growth under
non-optimum environmental conditions, reduction factors by light-,
drought- and temperature-limitation are considered in the growth
formulation. 

#### Tree growth formulation

Under non-optimal environmental conditions, a number of growth-limiting
factors reduce the optimal growth rate. These factors include, (1) light
limitation (light_rf), (2) degree-day limitation (DD_rf), and (3)
drought limitation (drStr_rf). Values for the reduction factor range
between 0 (maximum limitation) and 1 (no limitation).

    \\label{Fig_GrowthRedFcts}

\\end{figure}

These factors are implemented via Liebig's 'Law of the Minimum'. Thus,
the realized growth rate ($r_{i}(t)$) is calculated as the optimum
growth rate ($r_{s}$) reduced by the most limiting environmental factor
(Eq. \@ref(eq:GrowthRedminEq)).

$$
\begin{equation}
    r_{i}(t) = r_{s} \cdot min(light\_rf(t) , DD_rf(t), drStr_rf(t))
    (\#eq:GrowthRedminEq)
\end{equation}
$$

The realized maximum biomass $K_i$(t) is also limited by environmental
conditions, which reduce the maximum biomass ($K_s$) by the minimum of
growing degree-days (DD_rf) or drought (drStr_rf).

\
$$
\begin{equation}
    K_{i}(t) = K_{s} \cdot min(DD_rf(t), drStr_rf(t))
    (\#eq:MaxPlantSizeRedminEq)
\end{equation}
$$

Three different phenomenological growth models can be selected to
simulate tree growth in LandClim: (1) Logistic, (2) Gompertz and (3) von
Bertalanffy. For further descriptions about the background of each
equation, and for a comparison between the different models, see
\\citet{Elkin2013}. Equations used for the different growth models are:

`CHANGED ~~TO CHECK~~: I believe these equations are prediciting the individual tree biomass $B_i$, that multiplied by $N_c$ would give $B_c$", confirmed! The change has been done in the original manual pdf and here. It was only a typo present in LandCLim manual the article (Improving the formulation of tree growth and succession in a spatially explicit landscape model) and the thesis were correct`

Type 'LOGISTIC'

$$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dB_{i}}{dt} =  r_{i}(t) \cdot (1.0 - \frac{B_{i}(t)}{K_{i}(t)} \cdot B_{i}(t) 
\end{equation}
$$

Type 'GOMPERTZ' \$\$ \begin{equation}

    \frac{dB_{i}}{dt} =  r_{i}(t) \\cdot ( log(K_{i}) - log( B_{i}(t))) \cdot B_{i}(t)  

\end{equation} \$\$

Type 'BERTALANFFY' \$\$ \begin{equation}

  \frac{dB_{i}}{dt} =  3.0 \cdot r_{i}(t) \cdot K_{i}(t)\^{1/3} \cdot B_{i}(t)\^{2/3} - B_{i}(t) 

\end{equation} \$\$\

By default, the LOGISTIC growth model is used.

Tree cohorts

Quantitative information of tree diameter cohorts, i.e. groups of trees
of the same species and diameter.

These cohorts are characterized by the average biomass of an individual
tree (Bi ) and the number of trees in the cohort (Nc ), not just
presence/absence. Thus, the biomass of a cohort (Bc ) is calculated: Bc
= Bi Nc

The change of cohort biomass is tracked using a yearly time step in the
model.

Tree growth

The growth model is based on the a priori assumption of a logistic
growth relation for the isolated plant. This equation simply represents
a phenomenological description of individual tree growth, not a model of
population-level dynamics.

The individual growth rate, ri (t), is derived from a species-specific
maximum growth rate (rs ), which represents growth under optimum
environmental conditions. The growth rate ri (t) is calculated as a
function of three growth-limiting factors, light availability (light
rf), the sum of degree-days (DD rf) and a drought index (DrStr rf), as
described below. We applied Liebig's "Law of the Minimum" to combine
these growth response factors.
