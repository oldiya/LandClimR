### Tree regeneration {#Section_TreeRegeneration}

Tree regeneration is simulated based on seed availability (see section
on [seed dispersal](#sectionSeedDispersal)), environmental conditions
and depends on the intensity of [browsing](#sectionBrowsing) and
[grazing](#sectionPastureManagement). New tree cohorts are established
once every ten years. However, the model checks the establishment
potential for every year and calculates a decadal establishment
probability. The annual and decadal processes of the regeneration
routine are shown in further detail in the conceptual diagrams for the
[annual routine](\#Fig_RegenerationConcept_annual) and [decadal
routine](\#Fig_RegenerationConcept_decadal).

This 'establishment filter' approach is widely applied in forest gap
models \citep[e.g.,][]{Bugmann1994, Bugmann1996, Shugart1984}. A
particular year is favourable for establishment only if the following
criteria are met \citep{Schumacher2004}

```{=tex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Available \textbf{light at forest floor} is higher than a species-specific threshold value (\textit{minL$_{\text{s}}$});
\item \textbf{Winter temperature} (mean temperature of the coldest month) is higher than a threshold minimum temperature (\textit{minT$_{\text{s}}$}); 
\item The sum of \textbf{growing degree-days} exceeds the minimum species-specific requirement (\textit{minDD$_{\text{s}}$}); 
\item The \textbf{drought index} (\textit{Dl$_{\text{se}}$}) has to be lower than the species-specific maximum drought tolerance; 
\item \textbf{Browsing probability} has to be smaller than a uniformly distributed random number (see section \ref{browsing_section} for more information about browsing). 
\item A user defined \textbf{establishment coefficient} ($estCoeff_s$, defined in the landtype input file) has to be higher than a uniformly distributed random number. This variable represents additional factors which are not explicitly modelled.
\item If \textbf{pasture management} is turned on, then grazing intensity is also used (see section \ref{PastureManagement_section}) with a random number generator to determine if establishment could occur this year. Pasture management adds an additional constraint that there needs to be a minimum of five good establishment years \textit{in a row} for a cohort of that particular species to establish.
\end{enumerate}
```
The number of favourable establishment years for each species within
each decade ($estYrs_s$) is one of the factors used to determine
establishment densities (Eq. \ref{Establ_Density_Eq}).

The biomass of the newly established cohorts (B$_{\text{i}}$(t=10)) at
the end of the decade is calculated from an initial tree biomass
(B$_{\text{i}}$(t=0), 10 kg). Biomass increment over ten years is
tracked by an exponential growth function (Eq. \ref{Exp_Growth_Eq}).
Growth rates (r$_{\text{i}}$) are reduced every year by environmental
conditions in an similar way to those described in the 'tree growth'
sub-model (Eq. \ref{GrowthRed_min_Eq}). This results in larger
establishment biomass for species with higher growth rates and for those
with a higher tolerance of unfavourable environmental conditions.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}\label{Exp_Growth_Eq}
    B_{i}(t = 10):B_{i}(t+1) = B_{i}(t) \cdot (1 + r_{i}(t))
\end{equation}
```
Finally, the density of newly established trees (N$_{\text{c}}$(t=10))
is determined. N$_{\text{c}}$(t=10) is calculated based on a
user-defined potential establishment density ($potDens_{f}$), which is
reduced linearly by light availability at the forest floor ($avL_{s}$)
(decadal average), resulting in smaller densities of tree regeneration
under a dense canopy (see \citet{Schumacher2004} for further details).
The resulting tree density is distributed among all tree species with
available seeds ($sumSpec_{f}$) in proportion to the species' growth
performance in the establishment layer. Growth performance ($grPer_{s}$)
is defined here as the ratio of realized growth increment during the
last ten years to the maximum possible growth increment under optimal
environmental conditions. Species with better growth performance are
capable of establishing more trees than species whose saplings do not
grow well. Furthermore, the potential regeneration density of each
species is reduced proportionally to the species-specific number of
years over the last 10-year period when establishment would have been
possible ($estYrs_{s}$). This takes into account the fact that
unfavourable establishment years cause a reduction of a species'
establishment density (\ref{Establ_Density_Eq}).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}\label{Establ_Density_Eq}
    N_{c}(t = 10) = potDens_{f} \cdot avL_{ff} \cdot \frac{grPer_{s}}{\displaystyle\sum_{x=1}^{sumSpec_{f}} grPer_{s,x}} \cdot \frac{estYrs_{s}}{10}
\end{equation}
```
\textbf{Technical note:} LandClim Versions prior to V1.6 assumed that
establishment can only occur if the total stand biomass is at least ten
percent smaller than the maximum stand biomass. This assumption has been
removed in LandClim Version 1.6. with the introduction of a new cohort
self-shading (see section \ref{Chapter_Cohort_Fraction}). Here, very
dense stands reduce the amount of light on the forest floor which
prevents tree regeneration.

\subsection{Vegetative regeneration}
\label{Vegetative regeneration}
```
Vegetative reproduction of trees can be included in simulations with
LandClim (see \citet{Schumacher2004}). This type of reproduction can
only occur after the following disturbance types: fire, windthrow and
harvest . In order to enable this feature, species specific values for
\textbf{VegetativePropagules} have to be included in the landtype file
(xml tag $<$DefaultVegetativePropagules$>$). These vegetative propagules
are then added to the number of stems establishing in a post-disturbance
regeneration event. If this information is not included in the landtype
file, vegetative reproduction is inactive.

### Reproduction

## Understory interactions

We describe stand level processes and properties

## Forest stand scale processes

LandClim distinguishes between three different types of stand-scale
processes:

(1) Tree growth,

(2) Tree mortality

(3) Tree regeneration.

These processes are simulated for each cohort, i.e. groups of trees of
the same species and the same age within each patch (i.e. landscape
grid-cell). 

LandClim calculates the average biomass of an individual tree ($B_i$)
and the number of trees ($N_c$) within each cohort. The biomass
($B_{c}$) per cohort is thus calculated as:

$$
\begin{equation}
  B_{c} = B_{i} \cdot N_{c}
  (\#eq:biomasspercohoreq)
\end{equation}
$$

The change of cohort biomass per year is calculated with the
differential equation \@ref(eq:ChangeBiomassPerCohortEq). The first term
tracks the changes in biomass of individual plants (i.e. representation
of growth), whereas the second term tracks changes in the number of
individuals ($N_{c}$) within a cohort (thus accounting for mortality).

$$
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dB_{c}}{dt} = \frac{dB_{i}}{dt} \cdot N_{c} + \frac{dN_{c}}{dt} %\cdot B_{i}
  (\#eq:ChangeBiomassPerCohortEq)
\end{equation}
$$

### Treegrowth

In LandClim, tree growth is simulated via functional relationships,
which are based on a species-specific maximum growth rate ($r_{s}$;
growth under optimum environmental conditions) and a species-specific
maximum biomass ($K_{s}$; maximum biomass an individual tree of a
certain species can reach), representing growth under optimum
environmental conditions. To account for the reduction of growth under
non-optimum environmental conditions, reduction factors by light-,
drought- and temperature-limitation are considered in the growth
formulation. 

#### Tree growth formulation

Under non-optimal environmental conditions, a number of growth-limiting
factors reduce the optimal growth rate. These factors include, (1) light
limitation (light_rf), (2) degree-day limitation (DD_rf), and (3)
drought limitation (drStr_rf). Values for the reduction factor range
between 0 (maximum limitation) and 1 (no limitation).

\\begin{figure}[h!]

\\centering

\\includegraphics[width=1.00\\textwidth]{GrowthRedFcts.png}

    \\caption{Growth reduction functions for a) light response factor (light\\\_rf), b) degree-day response factor (DD\\\_rf) c) drought response factor (drSt\\\_rf)}

    \\label{Fig_GrowthRedFcts}

\\end{figure}

These factors are implemented via Liebig's 'Law of the Minimum'. Thus,
the realized growth rate ($r_{i}(t)$) is calculated as the optimum
growth rate ($r_{s}$) reduced by the most limiting environmental factor
(Eq. \@ref(eq:GrowthRedminEq)).

$$
\begin{equation}
    r_{i}(t) = r_{s} \cdot min(light\_rf(t) , DD_rf(t), drStr_rf(t))
    (\#eq:GrowthRedminEq)
\end{equation}
$$

The realized maximum biomass $K_i$(t) is also limited by environmental
conditions, which reduce the maximum biomass ($K_s$) by the minimum of
growing degree-days (DD_rf) or drought (drStr_rf).

\
$$
\begin{equation}
    K_{i}(t) = K_{s} \cdot min(DD_rf(t), drStr_rf(t))
    (\#eq:MaxPlantSizeRedminEq)
\end{equation}
$$

Three different phenomenological growth models can be selected to
simulate tree growth in LandClim: (1) Logistic, (2) Gompertz and (3) von
Bertalanffy. For further descriptions about the background of each
equation, and for a comparison between the different models, see
\\citet{Elkin2013}. Equations used for the different growth models are:

`CHANGED ~~TO CHECK~~: I believe these equations are prediciting the individual tree biomass $B_i$, that multiplied by $N_c$ would give $B_c$", confirmed! The change has been done in the original manual pdf and here. It was only a typo present in LandCLim manual the article (Improving the formulation of tree growth and succession in a spatially explicit landscape model) and the thesis were correct`

Type 'LOGISTIC'

$$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dB_{i}}{dt} =  r_{i}(t) \cdot (1.0 - \frac{B_{i}(t)}{K_{i}(t)} \cdot B_{i}(t) 
\end{equation}
$$

Type 'GOMPERTZ' \$\$ \\begin{equation}

\\frac{dB\_{i}}{dt} =  r\_{i}(t) \\\\cdot ( log(K\_{i}) - log(
B\_{i}(t))) \\cdot B\_{i}(t)  

\\end{equation} \$\$

Type 'BERTALANFFY' \$\$ \\begin{equation}

\\frac{dB\_{i}}{dt} =  3.0 \\cdot r\_{i}(t) \\cdot K\_{i}(t)\\\^{1/3}
\\cdot B\_{i}(t)\\\^{2/3} - B\_{i}(t) 

\\end{equation} \$\$\

By default, the LOGISTIC growth model is used.

Tree cohorts

Quantitative information of tree diameter cohorts, i.e. groups of trees
of the same species and diameter.

These cohorts are characterized by the average biomass of an individual
tree (Bi ) and the number of trees in the cohort (Nc ), not just
presence/absence. Thus, the biomass of a cohort (Bc ) is calculated: Bc
= Bi Nc

The change of cohort biomass is tracked using a yearly time step in the
model.

Tree growth

The growth model is based on the a priori assumption of a logistic
growth relation for the isolated plant. This equation simply represents
a phenomenological description of individual tree growth, not a model of
population-level dynamics.

The individual growth rate, ri (t), is derived from a species-specific
maximum growth rate (rs ), which represents growth under optimum
environmental conditions. The growth rate ri (t) is calculated as a
function of three growth-limiting factors, light availability (light
rf), the sum of degree-days (DD rf) and a drought index (DrStr rf), as
described below. We applied Liebig's "Law of the Minimum" to combine
these growth response factors.
