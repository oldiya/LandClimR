The current section provides an overview on the model, section 2 and 3 describes the science behind the model and its links to the source code. The (section 4)[#implementation] describes how to implement the model and the (last section)[#tutorials] is a collection of tutorials. If you just want to try the model we recommend that you go to the tutorials, if you want to understand the science behind the model explore the chapters 2 and 3, but if you are interested in using LandClim for your own research, have a look to the implementation section and please get in touch with us. 2.2 Model concept 2.2.1 What is LandClim? LandClim is a spatially explicit, dynamic forest landscape model which simulates vegetation dynamics driven by competition, environmental conditions and disturbances at large scales \\citep{Schumacher2004}. 2.2.2 What LandClim does? Landclim is a spatially explicit, raster-based, and stochastic model designed to simulate forest change in combination with disturbance regimes. The model simulates vegetation dynamics on large landscapes (100 –106 ha) and over long time spans (e.g. hundreds of years) in 1 or 10 year time steps. 2.2.3 How LandClim works? The design of LandClim reflects processes at two spatial scales (Fig.1.1): (1) the patch scale (patches / grid-cells e.g. of 25 x 25 m) and (2) the landscape scale (large geographical areas up to several thousand hectares) Structure of LandClim, modified from Schumacher et al. (2004) At the patch scale, the processes that influence forest succession are simulated on an annual time-step. This includes the simulation of establishment, growth, reproduction, mortality, intra- and inter-specific competition. Although the probabilities for tree establishment and mortality are calculated annually, the actual occurrence of establishment and regeneration events is only once a decade. Similar to other forest models, LandClim does not simulate individual trees but rather uses a cohort approach, i.e. groups of trees of the same age and species \\citep{Bugmann2001}. At the landscape scale, LandClim simulates how these patch scale processes are influenced by large-scale natural disturbances (e.g., fires, windthrow, bark beetles), forest management, and the physical environment. Interactions between cells and landscape scale processes are implemented on a decadal time step. Using different time-steps for different processes allows the model to efficiently simulate large landscapes, while maintaining a relatively fine spatial and thematic resolution. 2.2.4 Who is behind LandClim? LandClim was originally created by Harald Bugmann and many collaborators and researchers working in the Forest Ecology group at ETH have been part of its development. 2.2.5 Brief history of LandClim development Forest landscape models emerged from the need to simulate processes at large spatial scales (100s ha to 1000s km) for research and management purposes \\citep{Mladenoff2004}. This includes processes such as seed dispersal, and disturbances (e.g., fire, windthrow, bark beetle, management). A key challenge is the trade-off between mechanistic detail and spatial dynamics (Fig. X) as well as the trade-off between extent and resolution (Fig.X). Raster-based models have the advantage of being computationally faster and capable of representing the greatest range of resolution and extent. Trade-off between spatial dynamics and mechanistic detail, as shown in Mladenoff et al. (2004) Trade-off between spatial extent and resolution, as shown in Mladenoff et al. (2004) The development of LandClim was based on the structure of the raster-based LANDIS model \\citep{Mladenoff2004}. At this time, LANDIS Version 3.40 \\citep{He1999b} was not capable of simulating a number of important ecological processes important to capture forest dynamics in the Central European Alps \\citep{Schumacher2004}. This included: Interspecific competition effects during stand development. Species establishment probabilities that were self-emergent properties, which is pivotal for simulating the effects of changing environments (e.g., climate change) or transitions of species composition over climatic gradients. Detailed quantitative descriptions of forest structure in each grid cell, (i.e. stem density, biomass, dbh, etc.), to simulate competition more accurately and assess the effects on landscape properties relevant for ecosystem management. Therefore, the first version of LandClim featured a similar approach as used in the LANDIS model, but included an improved representation of tree growth and succession \\citep{Schumacher2004}. The tree growth (‘stand scale’) processes were based on a simplified version of the forest gap model FORCLIM \\citep{Bugmann1994}, in order to maintain computational efficiency at the large scale. Since the first LandClim release, the representation of forest dynamics at the patch and landscape scale has continuously been improved. This includes in particular improvements of tree growth, light and water competition, the inclusion of an herbaceous understorey layer, natural disturbances (e.g., fire and bark beetles), and various landscape-level management options (e.g, forest, pasture-woodland and meadows). 2.2.5.1 Tree cohorts Quantitative information of tree diameter cohorts, i.e. groups of trees of the same species and diameter. These cohorts are characterized by the average biomass of an individual tree (Bi ) and the number of trees in the cohort (Nc ), not just presence/absence. Thus, the biomass of a cohort (Bc ) is calculated: Bc = Bi Nc The change of cohort biomass is tracked using a yearly time step in the model. 2.2.5.2 Tree growth The growth model is based on the a priori assumption of a logistic growth relation for the isolated plant. This equation simply represents a phenomenological description of individual tree growth, not a model of population-level dynamics. The individual growth rate, ri (t), is derived from a species-specific maximum growth rate (rs ), which represents growth under optimum environmental conditions. The growth rate ri (t) is calculated as a function of three growth-limiting factors, light availability (light rf), the sum of degree-days (DD rf) and a drought index (DrStr rf), as described below. We applied Liebig’s “Law of the Minimum” to combine these growth response factors. 2.3 Application For what have been used the model and where and future sues and developments If you want to develop register here etc…. 2.4 How to use LandClim 2.4.1 Downloading LandClim How to download the code and the manuals etc support You can either download the source code (here)[add web link here] or directly download the executable files from (here)[add web link here]. 2.4.2 Using the source code After (downloading the LandClim source code )[### Downloading LandClim] you will have to publish the model to obtain the executable files.
