These metrics are based on average temperature and precipitation sums, which have to be provided for each year at a monthly resolution. The climatic parameters for every grid cell are adjusted for elevation using lapse rates, thus resulting in a landscape-wide input data set of weather conditions in any given simulation year. It is also possible to provide the climatic parameter values per grid cell. The derived bioclimatic variables are growing degree days (GDD) to represent temperature limitations, and a drought index (DI) to represent water limitations on growth. Technical note Temperature input data has to be defined as degree celcius and precipitation data as mm per month (with exception of the climate data ‘KBDI’ for fire-modelling, where temperature in kelvin and precipitation in inches is required, see fire section Technical note The lapses rates correspond to the changes in temperature (ºC change) per typically 100m change in altitude. The lapses rates for precipitation are also changes in precipitation by altitude (precipitation + precipitation lapse rate * (elevation - reference elevation) / lapse) 3.1 Calculation of Growing Degree Days The direct effect of temperature on vegetation is modelled via the annual sum of degree days. This index was used since it correlates well with plant species distribution \\citep{Woodward1988}. Monthly temperature is used to calculate the annual sum of degree days based on the method of \\citet{Bugmann1994} page 81. The growing degree days are estimated for cell for each month based on the mean temperature in the cell each month For evergreen species, the sum of growing degree days is calculated for the entire year (January to December): \\[ GDD = \\sum_{m=Jan}^{Dec} max(T_m - dtt, 0) \\cdot days + DDcorr(T_m) \\] For deciduous species, the growing degree day sum is restricted to the months when trees have leaves (i.e., April to October): \\[ GDD = \\sum_{m=Apr}^{Oct} max(T_m - dtt, 0) \\cdot days + DDcorr(T_m) \\] where \\(dtt\\) is the developmental threshold temperature ( = 5.5ºC), \\(days\\) is the average number of days per month ( = 30.5 days), and \\(DDcorr(T_{m})\\) is an empirical correction function developed by \\citet{Bugmann1994} page 81. The following parameter are available: P ara met ers D a t a t y p e Description dtt / \\(k\\) n u m e r i c It the developmental threshold temperature and its value is 5.5ºC .

It is defined in the src 3.2 Calculation of Drought Index LandClim calculates a water balance for each grid cell individually on a monthly basis which influences tree growth, wildfire and bark beetle dynamics via a drought index (see also section \\ref{Fire_subsection}). The water balance is controlled by topographic and environmental factors, i.e. monthly temperature, precipitation sum, slope and aspect. The current Version of LandClim (2.0) includes three different water balance modules, which differ in their representation of vegetation effects. ‘ORIGINAL’ Version, as described in \\citet{Schumacher2004} and \\citet{Bugmann1998} ‘VEGETATIONLAI’ Version, as described in \\citet{Elkin2015} ‘HERBTREE’ Version, as described in \\citet{Thrippleton2017a}. Technical note The water balance module has to be specified in the control file (e.g.,&lt;WaterBalanceModel&gt;ORIGINAL &lt;/WaterBalanceModel&gt; see also control file in the LandClim example folder). Besides, the choice of the water balance module determines the species parameter file to be used. By default, it is suggested to use the ORIGINAL water balance version with the species drought tolerances determined by \\citet{Henne2011} (see also species file in the LandClim example folder). The HERBTREE water balance version should only be used if a herbaceous PFT is included in the simulation (see details below). 3.3 Slope and aspect 3.4 Soil bucket size 3.5 Landtype masks 3.6 Climate input file (calculation of lapse rates etc.) "]]
