#### Description of the module

The wind module in LandClim currently offers two different approaches. One is based in the *old* windthrow module version and the most up to date version.

#### Input data

#### Project file parameters

The behavior of the wind module is configured by settings in the XML-control file \@ref(the-control-file-controlfile).

### Bark beetle

#### Table of Contents

#### Description of the module

LandClim simulates bark beetle dynamics by integrating forest susceptibility to bark beetle infestation (a proxy for the quality of bark beetle habitat) and bark beetle pressure. First, the spatial distribution of bark beetle infestation is determined at the landscape scale and second, bark beetle-induced tree mortality is evaluated at the tree cohort scale within each simulation cell (Fig. \ref{Fig_BarkBeetle}). Similar to all disturbance modules in LandClim, bark beetle disturbances are simulated on a decadal time step. The forest susceptibility assessment is conducted every decade, while the bark beetle pressure assessment is based on yearly bioclimatic data.

#### Forest susceptibility to beetle infestation

At the cell scale the susceptibility of live trees to beetle attack is evaluated using three factors:

1.  The drought stress of the host tree ($S_{d}$)

2.  The dominant age of the host tree ($S_{a}$)

3.  The relative basal area of the host tree ($S_{s}$)

These susceptibility indexes are all scaled to between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no susceptibility and 1 indicating maximum susceptibility. To translate these factors to drought-, age- and host share-induced susceptibility ($S_{d}$ , $S_{a}$ and $S_{s}$), we adopted the sigmoidal relationships proposed by \\citet{Netherer2005} and \\citet{Seidl2007a}.

##### The drought stress of the host tree

The equation used to define the relationship between the drought index (drI) (REF HERE TO DROUGHT INDEX SECTION IN THE MANUAL) and the drought index susceptibility ($S_{d}$) was defined by a logistic relationship as follow:

$$
Sd = \Big(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-r (drI- m)}}\Big)
$$

where

$$
m = \frac{(1-{drStrrf_{host}}^2) * drTol_{host}}{2}
$$

with drTol being the beetle host drought tolerance parameter that is added by the user in the species parameter file (ADD REFERENCE TO DESCRIPTION TO THIS FILE IN THE MANUAL), and drStr_rf being the species drought stress growth reduction factor. The species drought stress growth reduction factor (drStr_rf) is reached when the value of the in-built LandClim drought index (drI, Schumacher et al. 2004 LINK TO THE DESCRIPTION IN THIS MANUAL) has the value at which the drought induce susceptibility (Sdr) is close to its maximum (\~1).

The class \_soilMoistureAtMaxSusceptibility defines the species drought stress growth reduction factor: drStr_rf, for Norway spruce is set to 20%.

The species drought stress growth reduction factor (drStr_rf) is set by default to 20% (0.2, a value that will make sense for Norway spruce). drStr_rf is reached when the value of the in-built LandClim drought index (drI, Schumacher et al. 2004) has the value at which the drought induce susceptibility (Sdr) is close to its maximum (\~1).

The relation between the in-built LandClim drought index (drI) and the drought induce susceptibility (Sdr) is defined by:

$$
Sdr = \Big( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-r (drI- m)}} \Big)
$$

where

$$
m = \frac{(1-{drStrf_{rf}}^2) * drTol_{spr}}{2}
$$and

$$
r = - \frac{log \Big(\frac{1}{0.99}-1\Big)}{m}
$$

There are two alternative functions to this one:

**Logistic alternative** which is as the previous equation but adding a parameter. *Assuming that under conditions of very low drought (i.e., drI close to zero) the maximum resistance (i.e., negative susceptibility) of spruce to beetles amounts to 10% and 20% of the maximum possible susceptibility (drS = 1) we decreased the lower asymptote (A) of the logistic function Eq. A.1b to drS = -0.1 and -0.2, respectively*

$$
Sdr = A + \Big(\frac{1 - A}{1 + e^{-r (drI- m)}}\Big)
$$

where

$$
m = \frac{(1-{drStrf_{rf}}^2) * drTol_{spr}}{2}
$$

and

$$
r = - \frac{log \Big(\frac{1-0.99}{0.99-A}\Big)}{m}
$$

**Polynomial alternative**: *We extended Eq. A.1a by subtracting a unimodal function (probability density function of the beta distribution) such that the resulting polynome (Eq. A.1c) has a minimum (i.e., maximum resistance of spruce against beetles) at a drought (drI) level of 0.03. This assumes zero beetle susceptibility at zero drought, decreasing susceptibility (i.e. increasing resistance) until drI = 0.03 and increasing susceptibility for drI \> 0.03. We parameterized the scale parameter C such that the polynome reaches a minimum drS value (i.e. maximum resistance of spruce to beetles) of -0.1 and 0.2, respectively (Fig. A1b).*

$$
Sdr = \Big(\frac{1 }{1 + e^{-r (drI- m)}}\Big) -C*drI^{a-1}*(1-drI)^{b-1}
$$

Its default value is 0.01.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | This value can be a user defined parameter in the bark beetle XML parameter file |
