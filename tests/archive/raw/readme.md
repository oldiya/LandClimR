# DEV-data



During development of a new version this folder contains a set of files to test new features, modules and bug fixes. After the development is finished the files should be moved/copied to a new folder including the version number of the release.



## Disclaimer

Do not use this data set for "real" simulations, as it contains artificial input data.
